# 🧠 Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains the machine learning projects I completed during my **Data Science Internship**, where I worked on a variety of real-world datasets involving both classification and regression. These hands-on projects helped me understand the complete data science workflow — from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.


## 🚀 Projects Completed

### 1. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
- **Objective**: Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using petal/sepal dimensions.
- **Tech**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn
- **Models**: SVM, KNN, Random Forest

### 2. 📧 Email Spam Detection
- **Objective**: Detect whether an email is spam or not using natural language processing techniques.
- **Tech**: NLP (TF-IDF), Scikit-learn
- **Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes

### 3. 📉 Unemployment Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize unemployment trends in Pakistan from 2000 to 2023.
- **Tech**: Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Insights**: Time-based trends, economic impact of COVID-19, correlation heatmaps

### 4. 🚗 Car Price Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict the resale price of used cars based on mileage, fuel type, age, etc.
- **Tech**: Feature engineering, One-hot encoding
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor

### 5. 💰 Sales Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict sales figures based on features like store type, item visibility, etc.
- **Tech**: Regression models, EDA
- **Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
